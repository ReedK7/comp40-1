Acknowledgements: We received very generous help from many TAs 
and teaching fellows in Halligan, as well as Noah Mendelsohn. 
Thank you all for staying late to help us 40 students!

Implementation: We believe that we have implemented all three parts
correctly according to the specification. We have thoroughly tested each
part by individually. Please note that our test files are included, but
may no longer work due to advancing the code in a way that renders parts
of the tests useless. We used the test files to test each function
as we wrote them. Once we determined that our code functioned as intended,
we made design and implementation changes and began testing as a whole 
without test files.

Time: We spent approx 55-60 hours on this assignment.
